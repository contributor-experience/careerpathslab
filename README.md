# Career Paths Lab

This is a space to document the experiences of those who advanced their careers 
through contributing to open source. We hope these stories will inspire some 
to join the open source movement. 

This collective knowledge will also serve as a foundation for developing professional development 
programs that bring people from underrepresented groups into tech and open source.
